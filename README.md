Saket Engine is Data Oriented Application Development Framework made for Games, Visualizations, Applications and Engineering.



Currently it fully embraces .Net ecosystem. It for example is always using the newest version of .Net and is exclusively uses the built in numerics instead of a custom math library. That might however change in the future. Some modules might be made in C for true cross compatibility.






## Examples
Example game made in the engine. Is inspired by and uses assets of Wilmots warehouse:
